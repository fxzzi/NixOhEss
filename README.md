# NixOhEss - ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸

my (might i say crap) attempt at switching to [nixOS](https://nixos.org/).
With the power of [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
i am finally able to manager my dotfiles and system configuration togther in one place.

## wtf is this?

this is my nixOS configuration, it is a work in progress and i am still learning
how to use nixOS and home-manager. everything you see here is subject to change
and i am not responsible for any damage you do to your system by using this
stupid configuration.

## fazziPC and fazziGO?

yes, fazziPC is my desktop whilst fazziGO is my laptop. I'm working towards making
my config so modular that I can use it across both of them.

I was tired of having to `git rebase` my laptop and pc dotfiles branches on my
old dotfiles repo. This solves that :)
