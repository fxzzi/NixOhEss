## Overview

This repo consists of a relatively simple configuration for my desktop and
laptop with nixOS and home-manager.

two hostnames will be found in my config; fazziPC and fazziGO for my PC and
laptop respectively.

**DISCLAIMER!!** There is no guarantee that these configs will work for you.
These are merely my personal configurations and they do NOT come with a
warranty.

  for my entire configuration. Basic options like the username can be found
  here.
