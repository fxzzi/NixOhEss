# faarnixOS - ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸

my (might i say crap) attempt at switching to [nixOS](https://nixos.org/).
With the power of [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
i am finally able to manager my dotfiles and system configuration
togther in one place.

## wtf is this?

this is my nixOS configuration, it is a work in progress and i am still learning
how to use nixOS and home-manager. everything you see here is subject to change
and i am not responsible for any damage you do to your system by using this
stupid configuration.

## [TRANSITIONING???](./hm/transitioning)

this is what i mean when i said this configuration is stupid and unfinished.
this is literally a directory which just crudely symlinks some configs to
`$HOME` and i am still working through making everything actually good.
this is not how you're supposed to use nixOS. please don't recreate this
stunt in your own configuration.
