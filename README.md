## Overview

This repo consists of a relatively simple configuration for my desktop and
laptop with nixOS and home-manager.

two hostnames will be found in my config, fazziPC, and fazziGO for my PC and
laptop respectively.

## Structure

- [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix): The flake which delcares entry points and inputs
  for my entire configuration. Basic options like the username can be found
  here.
- [`hosts/`](./hosts/): All of the nixOS configuration is contained within here.
  - [`fazziPC.nix`](./hosts/fazziPC.nix): define all the options for my PC
  - [`fazziGO.nix`](./hosts/fazziGO.nix): define all the options for my laptop-
- [`home/`](./home/): All of the home-manager configuration is contained here.
  - [`fazziPC.nix`](./home/fazziPC.nix): define all the options for my PC
  - [`fazziGO.nix`](./home/fazziGO.nix): define all the options for my laptop
- [`overlays/`](./overlays/): contains a bunch of overlays which I use to
  override some nixpkgs and other stuff. Maybe to bump versions, or switch to
  forks / different branches of packages.
